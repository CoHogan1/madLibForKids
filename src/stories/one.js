let str = `Once upon a time, there was a lonely Prince named...${answer['one']}.
PRINCE: I'm lonely. His mother, the Queen of...${answer['two']} wanted to help him find a princess that would make him happy.
QUEEN: There are so many women out there that think they are princesses because they buy a Disney princess costume and dress up like ${answer['three']}
, but it doesn't mean you're royalty. So the Queen put a notice in the official royal news service called ${answer['four']}
stating that they were seeking the one true princess in the land who would win a date with the prince.
PRINCE: That's weird, Mom.
Every woman who thought she was a princess wanted a date with the prince
because he would one day be King and that meant she would become a Queen.
QUEEN: It's good to be Queen.
NARRATOR: So over ${answer['five']} princesses lined up
and waited for their turn to be interviewed by the Queen.
PRINCE: Ask them if they like ${answer['six']}, I love...${answer['six']}
QUEEN: I only need to do one thing to find a true princess.
I will invite each princess to stay the night and I will place a single...${answer['one']}

I have to leave before she sees me.
So the one true princess sneaked away early at ${answer['nine']}
QUEEN: Where did this princess go?
PRINCE: I will find her.
So the prince went looking for the princess and found her crying in the ${answer['ten']}
PRINCE: Why are you crying princess?
PRINCESS: Because I failed the Queen's test.
PRINCE: Actually you passed. You're the only one that couldn't sleep because of the ${answer['seven']}
under your mattress.
PRINCESS: Really?
PRINCE: That means you're the one true princess in the land.
PRINCESS: Does that mean I won a date with you?
PRINCE: Sure does. Where do you want to go?
PRINCESS: Let's go to ${answer['eleven']}
PRINCE: I love ${answer['eleven']}
NARRATOR: And they lived
${answer['twelve']} ever after!`
